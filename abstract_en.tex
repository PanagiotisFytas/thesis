Testing and verifying concurrent programs is quite a daunting task. Due to the non-determinism of the scheduler,
errors can occur only on specific process interleaving sequences and therefore, all possible different
schedulings should be examined. Currently, the most practical method of dealing with the combinatorial state space
explosion of this problem is a technique called Dynamic Partial Order Reduction (DPOR). As parallel processing
has become the dominant paradigm in modern computer architecture, developing parallel versions of DPOR algorithms is essential 
for scaling those algorithms to modern computers.

This thesis is concerned with the parallelization of Concuerror, a stateless model checking tool that uses various
DPOR techniques for testing concurrent Erlang programs. Specifically, we are going to focus on modifying Concuerror, 
in order to be able to explore different interleavings in parallel, and on developing parallel
versions for the two most efficient DPOR algorithms implemented in Concuerror: source-DPOR and optimal-DPOR.
Also, we are going to evaluate the speedup and scalability of our implementation on certain benchmarks that
are widely used for evaluating DPOR algorithms.
